CS-135 Assignments

Hello, my name is Gavin. I am a first year undergraduate student studying CS at the University of Waterloo.
CS 135 is the first official programming course that I have ever done. I am very proud of all the things I have learned in this course and also my assignments.

New to GitHub, I figured that uploading most (not all) of my assignments would be a good way to build up my profile and repository.

Feel free to see some of my code (they all have purposes that tells you what each function is supposed to do).
I always want to improve the efficiency of my code so if you think you can improve the efficiency of some of my functions, please send a pull-request.

Furthermore, all my code is written in DrRacket.

In terms of uploading, I will not upload all my assignments at once, I will upload them on a daily basis because I myself would like to review all the uploads and see whether I need to change some things or what not.
